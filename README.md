# Sansinukob

“kahit saan, kahit kailan, sansinukob.”

As a farmer, your goal is to stay productive while harvesting a variety of plants each day. Each study session helps your plants grow, and every plant has its own growth time before it can be harvested. As you progress, you’ll unlock rarer plants to grow and collect. Take on the challenge, accomplish your tasks, and build a flourishing collection!

Sansinukob is a nonprofit Pomodoro timer website and farming simulator heavily inspired by Stardew Valley. It features pixelated native and genetically modified plants from UPLB’s Makiling Botanic Garden (e.g., Mussaenda philippica). It serves as an official entry to the CodeSprout 2025 Hackathon developed by UPLB BS Computer Science students. Special acknowledgement is given to Stardew Valley for being the primary creative inspiration behind the project.
