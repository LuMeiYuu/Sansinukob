ðŸŒ±Inspiration
Our team, being fans of Stardew Valley, wanted to create something that carried the same relaxing vibe while still being useful. Thatâ€™s where the idea of a **pomodoro timer* came in. We thought it would be fun to combine productivity with a familiar and welcoming aesthetic, so we added touches of UPLB and Filipino culture to make it feel more personal and relatable.

ðŸŒ±What it does
Sansinukob is a web-based pomodoro timer that helps users stay productive while making the process less stressful. It follows the Pomodoro techniqueâ€”work intervals with short breaksâ€”but presents progress in a more engaging way, with visuals inspired by farming games and Filipino elements. The goal is to make focusing feel less like a chore and more like a simple routine you can actually enjoy.

ðŸŒ±How we built it
We started by sketching out ideas for the layout and style. Then we built the core timer using JavaScript, styled everything with HTML/CSS, and added details inspired by nature, UPLB, and Filipino culture. Along the way, we tested different designs, fixed bugs, and refined the site so the timer, animations, and overall look worked together smoothly.

ðŸŒ±Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges was keeping the design consistent while blending Filipino and UPLB-inspired elements with the Stardew Valley style. We also had to manage our time carefully since school deadlines and this project overlapped. On the technical side, syncing the timer with animations and fixing CSS bugs was a struggle. Lastly, we had to narrow down our ideas and focus on what was realistic to build within the time we had.

ðŸŒ±Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finishing Sansinukob felt like a big accomplishment for us. With only basic coding knowledge, it wasnâ€™t easyâ€”we often spent hours just fixing a single error. There were frustrating moments, but also a lot of satisfaction each time we solved a problem and saw the site improve. It may not be perfect, but completing it and making it work as intended was something weâ€™re proud of.

ðŸŒ±What we learned
One clear lesson we learned is to avoid cramming. Working under pressure only made things harder and more stressful. Starting earlier and pacing ourselves allowed us to think better, solve problems more effectively, and enjoy the process more.

ðŸŒ±What's next for SANSINUKOB
Next, we want to polish Sansinukob further by improving its design, fixing bugs, and adding more interactive features. Making it responsive across different devices is also a priority. Beyond that, weâ€™d like to expand its content and continue building on it as a project that helps us grow our skills while giving users a more engaging experience.
