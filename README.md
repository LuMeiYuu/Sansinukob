A Pomodoro timer website and farming simulator inspired by Stardew Valley.

A Pomodoro timer website and farming simulator inspired by Stardew Valley, featuring pixelated native and genetically modified plants from UPLBâ€™s Makiling Botanic Garden (e.g., Mussaenda philippica). Users unlock rare flora like native ferns and flowering shrubs as they reach productivity goals, each with educational facts. The site includes a built-in calendar, clock, and a menu to view unlocked and planted species based on daily accomplishments.
